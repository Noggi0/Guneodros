# Guneodros
Game Engine project written in C++.

I initially made this project just for the challenge, but now I want to dive a little bit more in this "Game Engine" field.

For now the project is in stand-by, as I am learning how to develop a renderer with Vulkan. Once I am confident enough, I will be implementing my own renderer here.

How to compile :
`g++ main.cpp -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -DNDEBUG`
